# Machine_Learning-Movie-Recommendation-
Built a Machine Learning Model to get similar kinds of movies as suggestion. Created a particular tag of each movie and 
converted those tags into vectors and then found the Cosine Similarity (-1 to 1) between the vectors.
ï‚· Built the model with proper planning and deployed through Streamlit to check how reliable the model is.
